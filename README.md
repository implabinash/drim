# DevRel Impact Model (DRIM)

A decision making framework for DevRel resource allocation

DRIM is a decision-making framework for DevRel resource allocation. It uses a simple 0–100 scoring model that helps DevRel teams decide what to work on. Instead of guessing between blogs, docs, videos, or events, DRIM gives you a structured way to score each option based on effort, demand, potential impact, and resources.

It doesn't predict exact outcomes; it helps you make smarter and more intentional decisions before you invest your time and resources.
