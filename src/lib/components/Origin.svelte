				It was 2 AM on a Tuesday before Q4 planning. The coffee was cold, and the Jira backlog was
				infinite. Every department wanted "just one small thing" from the DevRel team.
			</p>

			<p>
				I realized we were drowning in opportunity but starving for impact. We were busy, but not
				effective. I needed a shield—a way to say "no" that sounded like math, not an opinion.
			</p>

			<p>
				DRIM wasn't born in a boardroom. It was scribbled on a napkin at a falafel shop in Berlin,
				trying to calculate if a $50k sponsorship was worth the headache. (Spoiler: It wasn't).
