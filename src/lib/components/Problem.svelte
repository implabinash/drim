<p>
	Developer Relations teams often drown in "opportunity." Every conference, every integration, every
	blog post feels urgent.
</p>

<p>
	But not all work is equal. Without a clear decision-making framework, resources are allocated
	based on vibes, internal politics, or whoever shouts the loudest. This leads to burnout, lack of
	focus, and low-impact outcomes.
